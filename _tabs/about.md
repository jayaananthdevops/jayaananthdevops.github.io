With over 12 years of dedicated experience in the field of data engineering, I currently hold the role of an Senior AWS Data Consultant, in Australia. Throughout my journey, I've gained hands-on expertise in numerous facets of data engineering, including data modeling, integration, extraction, loading, ongoing maintenance, and the creation of decision support and reporting systems. My proficiency extends to a deep understanding of data warehousing principles and the development of ETL/ELT processes, notably leveraging tools such as Redshift and Snowflake.

I possess a strong passion for both Data Lakes and Modern Data Architecture

During my career, I've had the privilege of contributing my skills to a variety of projects spanning the pharmaceutical, retail, banking, and energy sectors. In addition to my core data engineering focus, I've developed a keen interest in machine learning and AI technologies, prompting me to embark on a journey of learning and exploration in these fields.

I received my Master’s degrees in VLSI Design from the SRM University- India
